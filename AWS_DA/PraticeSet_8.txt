5. Question
You created three S3 buckets – “mydomain.com”, “downloads.mydomain.com”, and “www.mydomain.com”. You uploaded your files, enabled static website hosting, specified both of the default documents under the “enable static website hosting” header, and set the “Make Public” permission for the objects in each of the three buckets. All that’s left for you to do is to create the Route 53 Aliases for the three buckets.
You are going to have your end users test your websites by browsing to http://mydomain.com/error.html, 
http://downloads.mydomain.com/index.html, and 
http://www.mydomain.com.
What problems will your testers encounter? Choose an answer from the options below

 A. http://mydomain.com/error.html will not work because you did not set a value for the error.html file
 B. http://www.mydomain.com will not work because the URL does not include a file name at the end of it.
 C. There will be no problems, all three sites should work.		-Correct
 D. http://downloads.mydomain.com/index.html will not work because the “downloads” prefix is not a supported prefix for S3 websites using Route 53 aliases

 A. "Fn::Join" : ["", [“http://”,{“Ref”:“demo”},”.s3”,”.amazonaws.com”]]
 B. "Fn::Join" : ["", [“http://”,{“GetAtt”:“demo”},”.s3-bucket-”,”Singapore-1”,”.amazon.com”]]
 C. "Fn::Join" : ["", [“http://”,{“GetAtt”:“demo”},”.s3-website-”,”ap-southeast-1”,”.amazonaws.com”]]
 D. "Fn::Join" : ["", [“http://”,{"Ref":"demo"},".s3-website-",{"Ref":"AWS::Region"},".amazonaws.com"]]		-Correct
Unattempted
AWS CloudFormation provides several built-in functions that help you manage your stacks. Use intrinsic functions in your templates to assign values to properties that are not available until runtime.
The website is then available at the region-specific website endpoint of the bucket:
.s3-website-.amazonaws.com
Hence Option A and B are wrong. Also you need to use the Ref function and not the GetAtt function hence Option C is wrong.

10. Question
A taxi company uses a mobile GPS application to track the location of each of their 60 cabs. The application records the taxi’s location to a DynamoDB table every 6 seconds. Each transmission is just under 1 KB, and throughput is spread evenly within that minute. How many units of write capacity should you specify for this table? Choose a correct answer from the options below

 A. 6
 B. 60
 C. 600
 D. 10		-Correct
Unattempted
Since we the item size is 1KB , hence if we near it the nearest 1KB , we get 1.
And since we have 60 cabs it becomes 1*60 = 60
Since we have a sample every 6 seconds , per second it comes to 60/6 = 10

AWS Doc shows the naming conventions for S3 buckets
The bucket name can be between 3 and 63 characters long, and can contain only lower-case characters, numbers, periods, and dashes.
Each label in the bucket name must start with a lowercase letter or number.
The bucket name cannot contain underscores, end with a dash, have consecutive periods, or use dashes adjacent to periods.
The bucket name cannot be formatted as an IP address (198.51.100.24).

14. Question
What would you set in your CloudFormation template to fire up different instance sizes based off of environment type? i.e. (If this is for prod, use m1.large instead of t1.micro) Choose a correct answer from the options below

 A. Outputs
 B. Resources
 C. Mappings
 D. Conditions		-Correct
Unattempted
The optional Conditions section includes statements that define when a resource is created or when a property is defined. For example, you can compare whether a value is equal to another value. Based on the result of that condition, you can conditionally create resources. If you have multiple conditions, separate them with commas.
For more information on Cloudformation conditions please visit the below link:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/conditions-section-structure.html
CloudFormation template comprises of various elements such as Parameters, Description, Outputs, Mappings, Conditions, Format Versions, Metadata, Resources etc out of which Resources is the only section which is mandatory for it to function, rest are all Optional.
Outputs: This section declares output values that you can import into other stacks.
Resources: Specifies the stack resources and their properties, such as an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance or an Amazon Simple Storage Service bucket.
Mappings:
This section matches a key to a corresponding set of named values. For example, if you want to set values based on a region, you can create a mapping that uses the region name as a key and contains the values you want to specify for each specific region.
However it does not support parameters, pseudo parameters, or intrinsic functions.
Conditions: This section controls whether certain resources are created or whether certain resource properties are assigned a value during stack creation or update. For example, you could conditionally create a resource that depends on whether the stack is for a production or test environment.
For the production environment, you might include Amazon EC2 instances with certain capabilities; however, for the test environment, you want to use reduced capabilities to save money. With conditions, you can define which resources are created and how they’re configured for each environment type.
So in this scenario, we need to launch various instance types either to production or to test environment. We don’t require large instances for test purposes. Hence the condition section checks whether the instance that need to be launched is for Prod or test environment based on the values provided during stack creation.

15. Question
You’re creating a forum DynamoDB database for hosting web forums. Your “thread” table contains the forum name and each “forum name” can have one or more “subjects”. What primary key type would you give the thread table in order to allow more than one subject to be tied to the forum primary key name? Choose an answer from the options below

 A. Primary and range
 B. Hash and Range		-Correct
 C. Hash
 D. Range and Hash
Unattempted
The partition key of an item is also known as its hash attribute. The term hash attribute derives from DynamoDB’s usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.
The sort key of an item is also known as its range attribute. The term range attribute derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.

16. Question
You need to announce an emergency downtime for a production AWS web application. This downtime notification will require different sets of instructions for different devices. All of the application users signed up to receive SNS notifications from the “mywebapp” topic when they began using the application and they are currently subscribed to this topic. What are appropriate ways for you to provide timely, device-specific instructions to end users when announcing this downtime? Choose an answer from the options below

 A. Create a different topic for each subscription type and send a message to SMS endpoints to one topic and a message to email endpoints to another topic
 B. Send multiple messages to the topic and ask users to ignore the messages that do not pertain to their device
 C. SNS is for automated notifications and you cannot send messages manually via SNS. The best option is to export the endpoints to a csv and send notifications to customers via your email client or SMS device.
 D. Send a single message, but customize the text in the SNS message field so that each device gets only the information that is appropriate for them		-Correct
Unattempted
In addition to sending custom data as key-value pairs, you can also send platform-specific key-value pairs within the JSON payload. For example, if you wanted to include time_to_live and collapse_key GCM parameters after the custom data key-value pairs included in the data GCM parameter, then the JSON payload without escaped quotation marks would look similar to the following:
{
   “GCM”:”{
      “data”:{
         “message”:”Check out these awesome deals!”,
         “url”:”www.amazon.com”
      },
         “time_to_live”: 3600,
         “collapse_key”: “deals”
   }”

17. Question
Which of these CloudFormation snippets of code will return an address that can be used to access our application from our browser if we’re using a resource type of AWS::ElasticLoadBalancing::LoadBalancer with Logical ID “ElasticLoadBalancer”? Choose an answer from the options below

 A. "Fn::Join" : [ "", [ "http://", { "Fn::GetAtt" : [ "ElasticLoadBalancer", "DNSName" ]}]]		-Correct
 B. "Fn::Join" : [ "", [ "http://", { "Ref" : ["ElasticLoadBalancer" }]]
 C. "Fn::Join" : [ "http://", [ ".", { "Fn::GetAtt" : [ "ElasticLoadBalancer", "DNSName" ]}]]
 D. "Fn::Join" : [ "", [ "http://", { "Fn::GetAtt" : [ "ElasticLoadBalancer", "URL" ]}]]
Unattempted
We have to use the Fn::GetAtt to get the DNSName of the Elastic load balancer. Hence option B and D are wrong. Then we don’t need any delimiter, hence Option C is wrong. For more information on Fn::GetAtt command please visit the below link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/intrinsic-function-reference-getatt.html



18. Question

 A. You can delete the subscription from the SNS topic responsible for the emails		-Correct
 B. You can delete the endpoint from the SNS subscription responsible for the emails
 C. You can delete the SNS topic responsible for the emails
 D. He can use the unsubscribe information provided in the emails		-Correct
Unattempted
Every request has a unsubscribe URL which can be used. Also from the aws console , one can just delete the subscription For more information on SNS subscription please visit the below link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_Subscribe.html



19. Question
You have an Amazon S3 bucket that you use to store objects. You’d like to encrypt some of the new objects you upload to this bucket. What header do you need to use in order to request server-side encryption when using the REST API? Choose the correct answer from the options below

 A. x-amz-content-sha256
 B. x-amz-server-side-encryption		-Correct
 C. Content-MD5
 D. No header is needed
Unattempted
Server-side encryption is about protecting data at rest. Server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) employs strong multi-factor encryption. Amazon S3 encrypts each object with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it regularly rotates. Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), to encrypt your data.
Amazon S3 supports bucket policies that you can use if you require server-side encryption for all objects that are stored in your bucket. 
For this you need to set the header as x-amz-server-side-encryption in the REST API call.
For more information on S3 server side encryption, please refer to the below URL:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html

21. Question
If your table item’s size is 3KB and you want to have 90 strongly consistent reads per second, how many read capacity units will you need to provision on the table? Choose the correct answer from the options below

 A. 90		-Correct
 B. 45
 C. 10
 D. 19
Unattempted
When we round off the item size to 4KB, we get 1 read per item. Since there are 90 requests , it means 90 reads per seconds. For more information on provisioned throughtput, please refer to the below URL: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ProvisionedThroughput.html



22. Question

 A. An XML document with parameters like Message, Source, Destination, Type
 B. A JSON document with parameters like Message, Source, Destination, Type
 C. A JSON document with parameters like Message, Signature, Subject, Type		-Correct
 D. An XML document with parameters like Message, Signature, Subject, Type
Unattempted
AWS documentation on the format of the SNS message. There is no source , hence Option A and B are wrong. And since SNS messages are JSON, only option C is correct.

25. Question
Your application instance takes 60 seconds to process instructions received in an SQS message. Assuming the SQS queue is configured with the default Visibility Timeout, what is the best way to configure your application to ensure that no other instances retrieve a message that has already been processed or is currently being processed? Choose the correct answer from the options below

 A. Use the ReceiveMessage API call to retrieve the message, the ChangeMessageVisibility API call to increase the visibility timeout, and the DeleteMessage API call to delete the message when processing completes		-Correct
 B. Use the ReceiveMessage API call to retrieve the message and the DeleteMessage API call to delete the message when processing completes.
 C. Use the ReceiveMessage API call to retrieve the message, the ChangeMessageVisibility API call to lower the visibility timeout, and the DeleteMessage API call to delete the message when processing completes.
 D. Use ReceiveMessage API call to retrieve the message, SetQueueAttributes API call to lower the visibility timeout, and DeleteMessage API call to delete the message when processing completes.
Unattempted
SQS has a visibility timeout which gets into effect when a message is read from the SQS queue. The default time is 30 seconds, so normally after a message is read, it would not be available for 30 seconds until the message is processed. So you need to increase the visibility timeout to 60 seconds , then read the message and then delete it. For more information on SQS visibility timeout, please refer to the below URL: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-visibility-timeout.html



26. Question
Your supervisor asks you to find a solution for scheduling a sequence of tasks. The sequence may take several months to complete and it’s very important that no tasks are processed more than once. What AWS service should you recommend? Choose the correct answer from the options below

 A. SQS
 B. OpsWorks
 C. CloudFormation
 D. SWF		-Correct
Unattempted
The benefits of SWF are clearly mentioned in the documentation When building solutions to coordinate tasks in a distributed environment, developers have to account for several variables. Tasks that drive processing steps can be long-running and may fail, timeout, or require restarts. They often complete with varying throughputs and latencies. Tracking and visualizing tasks in all these cases is not only challenging, but is also undifferentiated work. As applications and tasks scale up, developers face difficult distributed systems’ problems. For example, they must ensure that a task is assigned only once and that its outcome is tracked reliably through unexpected failures and outages. By using Amazon SWF, developers can focus on their differentiated application logic, i.e. how to process tasks and how to coordinate them. For more information on SWF, please refer to the below URL: https://aws.amazon.com/swf/faqs/



27. Question
A recent increase in the amount of users of an application hosted on an EC2 instance that you manage has caused the instance’s OS to run out of CPU resources and crash. The crash caused several users’ unsaved data to be lost and your supervisor wants to know how this problem can be avoided in the future.
Which of the following would you not recommend?

 A. Redesign the application so that users’ unsaved data is periodically written to disk.
 B. Take frequent snapshots of the EBS volume during business hours to ensure users’ data is backed up.		-Correct
 C. Snapshot the EBS volume and re-deploy the application server as a larger instance type.
 D. Use autoscaling to deploy additional application server instances when load is high.
Unattempted
If you take snapshots during business hours , the situation can become worse since I/O is required to create the snapshot. Hence this is the worse solution to recommend for the problem. For more information on EBS snapshots, please refer to the below URL: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EBSSnapshots.html



28. Question

30. Question
In SQS What does the setting, VisibilityTimeout = 0 have an effect on your message? Choose the correct answer from the options below

 A. Removes the message immediately upon receipt
 B. Makes the message immediately available		-Correct
 C. Automatically invokes a reprocessing call on your component
 D. None of the above
Unattempted
SQS has a visibility timeout which gets into effect when a message is read from the SQS queue. The default time is 30 seconds, so normally after a message is read, it would not be available for 30 seconds until the message is processed. But if you set the visibility timeout it would mean that the message would be available instantly.

Unattempted
Amazon SQS makes a best effort to preserve order in messages, but due to the distributed nature of the queue, we cannot guarantee that you will receive messages in the exact order you sent them. You typically place sequencing information or timestamps in your messages so that you can reorder them upon receipt. Please find the article on the link which shows that messages can be in any order URL: https://aws.amazon.com/articles/Amazon-SQS/1343#03

 B. Launch an EC2 instance with the IAM user included in the launch configuration.
 C. Create an IAM role that allows write access to the DynamoDB table and attach to the instance.		-Correct
 D. Create an IAM user and allow programmatic access.
Unattempted
As the question mentions no keys are allowed to be stored on EC2 instance and hence IAM user is incorrect option. Statement from AWS with regard to controlling access to DynamoDB:  Applications running on Amazon EC2 – You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS API requests. This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the instance. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to get temporary credentials. For more information, see Using an IAM Role to Grant Permissions to Applications Running on Amazon EC2 Instances in the IAM User Guide.

65. Question
You are providing AWS consulting services for a company developing a new mobile application that will be leveraging Amazon SNS Mobile Push for push notifications. In order to send direct notification messages to individual devices each device registration identifier or token needs to be registered with SNS; however the developers are not sure of the best way to do this. You advise them to

 A. Call the CreatePlatformEndPoint API function to register multiple device tokens.		-Correct
 B. Bulk upload the device tokens contained in a CSV file via the AWS Management Console.
 C. Let the push notification service (e.g. Amazon Device Messaging) handle the registration.
 D. Implement a token vending service to handle the registration.
Unattempted
The CreatePlatformEndPoint  API creates an endpoint for a device and mobile app on one of the supported push notification services, such as GCM and APNS. CreatePlatformEndpoint requires the PlatformApplicationArn that is returned from CreatePlatformApplication. The EndpointArn that is returned when using CreatePlatformEndpointcan then be used by the Publish action to send a message to a mobile app or by the Subscribe action for subscription to a topic.  For more information on the command please visit the below link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_CreatePlatformEndpoint.html
