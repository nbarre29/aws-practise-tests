20. Question
What are some of the benefits of using AWS SWF? Choose the correct answer from the options below.

 A. Centralize the coordination of steps in the application.
 B. Automate workflows that include human tasks
 C. Manage the flow of work between application components
 D. All of the above		-Correct
Unattempted
Amazon SWF can be used to address many challenges that arise while building applications with distributed components. For example, you can use Amazon SWF and the accompanying AWS Flow Framework for:
Writing your applications as asynchronous programs using simple programming constructs that abstract details such as initiating tasks to run remotely and tracking the program’s runtime state.
Maintaining your application’s execution state (e.g. which steps have completed, which ones are running, etc.). You do not have to use databases, custom systems, or ad hoc solutions to keep execution state.
Communicating and managing the flow of work between your application components. With Amazon SWF, you do not need to design a messaging protocol or worry about lost and duplicated tasks.
Centralizing the coordination of steps in your application. Your coordination logic does not have to be scattered across different components, but can be encapsulated in a single program.
Integrating a range of programs and components, including legacy systems and 3rd party cloud services, into your applications. By allowing your application flexibility in where and in what combination the application components are deployed, Amazon SWF helps you gradually migrate application components from private data centers to public cloud infrastructure without disrupting the application availability or performance.
Automating workflows that include long-running human tasks (e.g. approvals, reviews, investigations, etc.) Amazon SWF reliably tracks the status of processing steps that run up to several days or months.

21. Question
You are writing an AWS CloudFormation Template to create a static S3 website configuration. The resources section of this template will be used for access control of the bucket and is defined in the 5th line of the below code snippet. What should the value of “AccessControl” be so that the owner of the bucket gets full control and all users get READ access only.
“Resources” : {
     “S3Bucket” : {
            “Type” : “AWS::S3::Bucket”,
             “Properties” : {
                     “AccessControl” : “ANSWER TO THE QUESTION”,
                      “BucketName”: { “Ref” : “BucketName” },
                      “WebsiteConfiguration” : {
                                “IndexDocument” : “index.html”,
                                “ErrorDocument” : “error.html”
                        }
             }
  }

 A. BucketOwnerRead
 B. BucketOwnerFullControl
 C. AuthenticatedRead
 D. PublicRead		-Correct
Unattempted
Since the question states that all users need read access, then by default we need to assign the public read permission
For static website, it needs to be publicly readable only permissions for all users to access the site.
For more information refer to AWS documentation @ URL:
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/quickref-s3.html#scenario-s3-bucket-website
Property AccessControl should be set to canned ACL PublicRead which grants FULL_CONTROL to the owner and READ access to AllUsers group.

25. Question
Which command line commands list all current stacks in your CloudFormation service? Choose the 2 correct answers from the options below

 A. AWS cloudformation create-stack
 B. AWS cloudformation list-stacks		-Correct
 C. AWS cloudformation describe-stack-resources
 D. AWS cloudformation describe-stacks		-Correct
Unattempted
The AWS cloudformation list-stacks command enables you to get a list of any of the stacks you have created (even those which have been deleted up to 90 days). You can use an option to filter results by stack status, such as CREATE_COMPLETE and DELETE_COMPLETE. The AWS cloudformation list-stackscommand returns summary information about any of your running or deleted stacks, including the name, stack identifier, template, and status. The AWS cloudformation describe-stacks command provides information on your running stacks. You can use an option to filter results on a stack name. This command returns information about the stack, including the name, stack identifier, and status. For more information on describing stacks, please refer to the below link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-describing-stacks.html



26. Question
What is the default behavior of a CloudFormation stack if creation fails? Choose the correct answers from the options below

 A. Rollback		-Correct
 B. Delete
 C. Undo
 D. None of the above; the stack continues creating and the failed resource is ignored
Unattempted
By default, the “automatic rollback on error” feature is enabled. This will cause all AWS resources that AWS CloudFormation created successfully for a stack up to the point where an error occurred to be deleted. This is useful when, for example, you accidentally exceed your default limit of Elastic IP addresses, or you don’t have access to an EC2 AMI you’re trying to run. This feature enables you to rely on the fact that stacks are either fully created, or not at all, which simplifies system administration and layered solutions built on top of AWS CloudFormation. For more information on cloudformation, please refer to the below link: https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/faqs/



27. Question
The following code snippet is the parameters section of a CloudFormation template that you have written.

     “KeyName”: {
             “Description” : “answer to the question”,
              “Type”: “AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName”,
                …
       }
}
Which of the the following is the best description of what this section will do once you run your CloudFormation template?

 A. It will ask you if you want to create a new key pair to use.
 B. It will ask you to input any name and that name will then be the name of the new key pair it will generate.
 C. It will ask you to provide the name of an existing EC2 KeyPair to use.		-Correct
 D. It will create a new key pair automatically for you named KeyName.
Unattempted
When you use AWS-specific parameter types, anyone who uses your template to create or update a stack must specify existing AWS values that are in his account and in the region for the current stack. AWS-specific parameter types help ensure that input values for these types exist and are correct before AWS CloudFormation creates or updates any resources. For example, if you use the AWS::EC2::KeyPair::KeyName parameter type, AWS CloudFormation validates the input value against users’ existing key pair names before it creates any resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances.

32. Question
You have created a mobile application that relies on reading data from DynamoDB. How could you give each mobile device permissions to read from DynamoDB? Choose an answer from the options below

 A. Connect to an EC2 instance which will pull the data from DynamoDB securely
 B. Create an IAM role that can be assumed by an app that allows federated users		-Correct
 C. Add the username and password into the app code
 D. Create an IAM user
Unattempted
Before your application can access a database, it must be authenticated to ensure that the application is allowed to use the database, and authorized so that the application can only perform actions for which it has permissions.
Please refer to the link below for more information: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/SQLtoNoSQL.Accessing.html
When providing permission to any AWS service from an EC2 instance, you need to always use IAM roles. So here you would create an IAM Role with permissions to add Cloudwatch metrics. To specify a role, follow the below steps
Step 1) Go to your security dashboard and click on Roles. Click on Create New Role.
Step 2) Provide a name to the role and select the Role Type as Amazon EC2.
Step 3) Attach the relevant policy
Step 4) Once the role is created, when launching an EC2 instance, you can mention the role the EC2 instance needs to be launched with.
Since other options have no mention of IAM roles, all of them are invalid.

   “Id”: “Policy1441839160967”,
   “Version”: “2012-10-17”,
   “Statement”: [
    {
         “Sid”: “Stmt1441839157568”,
         “Action”: [
             “s3:ListBucket”
          ],
        “Effect”: “Allow”,
        “Resource”: “arn:AWS:s3:::demo.testbucket.2 ”
     }
  ]
}

 A. This is a NACL
 B. S3 bucket policies require a Principal be defined		-Correct
 C. The Resource name is incorrect - S3 bucket names cannot contain periods
 D. This is an IAM policy
Unattempted
In its most basic sense, a policy contains the following elements:
Resources – Buckets and objects are the Amazon S3 resources for which you can allow or deny permissions. In a policy, you use the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) to identify the resource.
Actions – For each resource, Amazon S3 supports a set of operations. You identify resource operations you will allow (or deny) by using action keywords
Effect – What the effect will be when the user requests the specific action—this can be either allow or deny.
Principal – The account or user who is allowed access to the actions and resources in the statement. You specify a principal only in a bucket policy. It is the user, account, service, or other entity who is the recipient of this permission. In a user policy, the user to which the policy is attached is the implicit principal.

34. Question
Which DynamoDB API call does not consume capacity units? Choose the correct answer from the options below

 A. DeleteItem
 B. UpdateTable		-Correct
 C. GetItem
 D. UpdateItem
Unattempted
Modifies the provisioned throughput settings, global secondary indexes, or DynamoDB Streams settings for a given table. All of the other commands access the items of the table and hence consumes capacity units For more information on  UpdateTable command please visit the below link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_UpdateTable.html



35. Question
As you retrieve information from DynamoDB, you receive this error: “ProvisionedThroughputExceededException”, but upon investigation you notice that you’re not exceeding your table read capacity throughput. What is causing this error? Choose the correct answer from the options below

 A. DynamoDB needs a short amount of time to pre-warm before being able to handle a spike in demand, even if a table has enough throughput capacity configured
 B. Metrics reported by AWS are not always real-time and could take a minute or so to appear
 C. This happens when using sort keys because they consume an extra read capacity for each call which doubles throughput
 D. You exceeded your maximum allowed provisioned throughput for a table or for one or more global secondary indexes.		-Correct

37. Question
Your items are 6KB in size and you want to have 100 strongly consistent reads per second. How many read capacity units do you need to provision? Choose the correct answer from the options below

 A. 50
 B. 100
 C. 80
 D. 200		-Correct
Unattempted
Since each item is 6KB and if we near it to the nearest 4KB , we get 2. Since we need 100 strongly consistent , it becomes (100*2) = 200.

39. Question
Since S3 object are stored lexicographically, by introducing “randomness” to your S3 names it helps S3 storage distribute the I/O load across more than one partition. Given the following examples, how could you add a hashed prefix to the naming convention to increase I/O performance? Choose the correct answer from the options below

 A. bucket/8761-2010-26-05-15-00-00/8761/myfolder234234/photo1.jpg
 B. 8761bucket/2010-26-05-15-00-00/myfolder234234/photo1.jpg
 C. bucket/8761-2010-26-05-15-00-00/myfolder234234/photo1.jpg		-Correct
 D. bucket/2010-26-05-15-00-00/bucket/myfolder234234/photo1.jpg
Unattempted
One way to introduce randomness to key names is to add a hash string as prefix to the key name. For example, you can compute an MD5 hash of the character sequence that you plan to assign as the key name. From the hash, pick a specific number of characters, and add them as the prefix to the key name.

Which API call would you use to query an item by it’s primary hash key? Choose the correct answer from the options below

 A. PutItem
 B. Scan
 C. GetItem		-Correct
 D. query
Unattempted
The GetItem operation returns a set of attributes for the item with the given primary key. If there is no matching item, GetItem does not return any data and there will be no Item element in the response.
GetItem provides an eventually consistent read by default. If your application requires a strongly consistent read, set ConsistentRead to true. Although a strongly consistent read might take more time than an eventually consistent read, it always returns the last updated value.

45. Question
You have created an Elastic Load Balancer with Duration-Based sticky sessions enabled in front of your six EC2 web application instances in US-West-2. For High Availability, there are three web application instances in Availability Zone 1 and three web application instances in Availability Zone 2. To load test, you set up a software-based load tester in Availability Zone 2 to send traffic to the Elastic Load Balancer, as well as letting several hundred users browse to the ELB’s hostname. After a while, you notice that the users’ sessions are spread evenly across the EC2 instances in both AZ’s, but the software-based load tester’s traffic is hitting only the instances in Availability Zone 2. What steps can you take to resolve this problem? Choose the 2 correct answer from the options below

 A. Create a software-based load tester in US-East-1 and test from there
 B. Force the software-based load tester to re-resolve DNS before every request		-Correct
 C. Use a third party load-testing service to send requests from globally distributed clients		-Correct
 D. Switch to Application-Controlled sticky sessions
Unattempted
“If you do not ensure that DNS is re-resolved or use multiple test clients to simulate increased load, the test may continue to hit a single IP address when Elastic Load Balancing has actually allocated many more IP addresses. Because your end users will not all be resolving to that single IP address, your test will not be a realistic sampling of real-world behavior.” Please refer to the below article URL: http://aws.amazon.com/articles/1636185810492479



46. Question
You run an ad-supported photo sharing website using S3 to serve photos to visitors of your site. At some point you find out that other sites have been linking to the photos on your site, causing loss to your business. What is an effective method to mitigate this? Choose the correct answer from the options below

 A. Use CloudFront distributions for static content.
 B. Store photos on an EBS volume of the web server.
 C. Remove public read access and use signed URLs with expiry dates.		-Correct
 D. Block the IPs of the offending websites in Security Groups.
Unattempted
You can distribute private content using a signed URL that is valid for only a short time—possibly for as little as a few minutes. Signed URLs that are valid for such a short period are good for distributing content on-the-fly to a user for a limited purpose, such as distributing movie rentals or music downloads to customers on demand.

 A. The SNS queue is not AutoScaling properly. Verify by viewing Performance Statistics in SNS.
 B. The SNS Subscription is not configured for Email notifications. Verify by viewing Subscriptions for the appropriate Topic in SNS		-Correct
 C. Your supervisor has not responded to the confirmation email sent from SNS when you added a subscription for her email address. Verify by viewing Subscriptions for the appropriate Topic in SNS		-Correct
 D. Billing alerts are not configured. Verify by viewing Billing Alerts in Account Preferences		-Correct
Unattempted
To receive messages published to a topic, you have to subscribe an endpoint to that topic. An endpoint is a mobile app, web server, email address, or an Amazon SQS queue that can receive notification messages from Amazon SNS. Once you subscribe an endpoint to a topic and the subscription is confirmed, the endpoint will receive all messages published to that topic.
For more information on Topic subscription please visit the below link:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/SubscribeTopic.html
Before you create a billing alarm, you must enable billing alerts. You need to do this only once. After you enable billing alerts, you can’t turn them off.

 A. DynamoDB uses a pessimistic locking model.
 B. DynamoDB restricts item access during reads.
 C. DynamoDB uses conditional writes for consistency.		-Correct
 D. DynamoDB restricts item access during writes.
Unattempted
To help clients coordinate writes to data items, DynamoDB supports conditional writes for PutItem,DeleteItem, and UpdateItem operations. With a conditional write, an operation succeeds only if the item attributes meet one or more expected conditions; otherwise it returns an error.

56. Question
You receive a call from a potential client who explains that one of the many services they offer is a website running on a t2.micro EC2 instance where users can submit requests for customized e-cards to be sent to their friends and family. The e-card website administrator was on a cruise and was shocked when he returned to the office in mid-January to find hundreds of angry emails complaining that customers’ loved ones had not received their Christmas cards. He also had several emails from CloudWatch alerting him that the SQS queue for the e-card application had grown to over 500 messages on December 25th. You investigate and find that the problem was caused by a crashed EC2 instance which serves as an application server. What do you advise your client to do first? Choose the correct answer from the options below

 A. Use an autoscaling group to create as many application servers as needed to process all of the Christmas card SQS messages.
 B. Reboot the application server immediately so that it begins processing the Christmas card SQS messages.
 C. Redeploy the application server as a larger instance type so that it can process the Christmas card SQS messages faster.
 D. Send an apology to the customers notifying them that their cards will not be delivered.		-Correct

61. Question
A corporate web application is deployed within an Amazon VPC, and is connected to the corporate data center via IPSec VPN. The application must authenticate against the on-premise LDAP server. Once authenticated, logged-in users can only access an S3 keyspace specific to the user. Choose 2 answer from the options below

 A. The application authenticates against LDAP. The application then calls the IAM Security Service to login to IAM using the LDAP credentials. The application can use the IAM temporary credentials to access the appropriate S3 bucket.
 B. Develop an identity broker which authenticates against IAM Security Token Service to assume an IAM Role to get temporary AWS security credentials. The application calls the identity broker to get AWS temporary security credentials with access to the app
 C. Develop an identity broker which authenticates against LDAP, and then calls IAM Security Token Service to get IAM federated user credentials. The application calls the identity broker to get IAM federated user credentials.		-Correct
 D. The application authenticates against LDAP, and retrieves the name of an IAM role associated with the user. The application then calls the IAM Security Token Service to assume that IAM Role. The application can use the temporary credentials to access the app.		-Correct
Unattempted
If you already manage user identities outside of AWS, you can use IAM identity providers instead of creating IAM users in your AWS account. With an identity provider , you can manage your user identities outside of AWS and give these external user identities permissions to use AWS resources in your account. This is useful if your organization already has its own identity system, such as a corporate user directory. It is also useful if you are creating a mobile app or web application that requires access to AWS resources.

Which statement about DynamoDB is true? Choose a correct answer from the options below

 A. DynamoDB does not support conditional writes.
 B. DynamoDB uses optimistic concurrency control.		-Correct
 C. DynamoDB is a relational database service.
 D. None of the above
Unattempted
Optimistic locking is a strategy to ensure that the client-side item that you are updating (or deleting) is the same as the item in DynamoDB. If you use this strategy, then your database writes are protected from being overwritten by the writes of others — and vice-versa For more information on DynamoDB optimistic concurrency control please visit the below link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBMapper.OptimisticLocking.html



63. Question
Which of the following will not make a CloudFormation stack deployment to ‘rollback’? Choose a correct answer from the options below.

 A. The template contains invalid JSON syntax		-Correct
 B. A subnet specified in the template does not exist
 C. An AMI specified in the template exists in a different region than the one in which the stack is being deployed.
 D. The template specifies an instance-store backed AMI and an incompatible EC2 instance type.
Unattempted
Here we are looking at the best practices while deploying AWS CloudFormation.
According to the best practices we can validate the stack templates which will help you to identify the syntax and semantic error, such as circular dependencies, before AWS CloudFormation creates any resources. So If we are encountering a JSON syntax error it will return a template validation error prior to the creation and  deployment of resources itself.

65. Question
You are creating several DynamoDB tables for a new project. While doing so, you receive the error message, “LimitExceededException.” You are well below the maximum number of tables per account and there is no read or write activity on the tables yet. Why have you received this error? Choose a correct answer from the options below

 A. You attempted to create GSI at the time of table creation.
 B. You attempted to create local indexes at the same time you created the tables
 C. You failed to pre-warm the tables
 D. You attempted to create more than one table with a secondary index at a time		-Correct
Unattempted
There are too many concurrent control plane operations. The cumulative number of tables and indexes in the CREATING, DELETING or UPDATING state cannot exceed 10.
For more information on dynamo DB errors please visit the below link:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Programming.Errors.html
You can create up to 5 Global Secondary Indexes at the same time while creating a table and we should also provide ProvisionedThroughput settings for the index too. It will not throw the LimitExceededException error.
However if you create more than 1 table with GSI simultaneously it will give us an LimitExceededException error.
More information is available at: 
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/GSI.OnlineOps.html
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Programming.Errors.html#Programming.Errors.MessagesAndCodes
If you want to create more than one table with secondary indexes, you must do so sequentially. For example, you would create the first table and wait for it to become ACTIVE, create the next table and wait for it to become ACTIVE, and so on. If you attempt to concurrently create more than one table with a secondary index, DynamoDB will return a LimitExceededException.
