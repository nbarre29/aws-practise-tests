2. Question
In DynamoDB, an atomic counter allows all write requests to be applied in the order they are received by incrementing or decrementing the attribute value.

 A. True		-Correct
 B. False
Unattempted
DynamoDB supports atomic counters, where you use the UpdateItem operation to increment or decrement the value of an existing attribute without interfering with other write requests. (All write requests are applied in the order in which they were received.) For example, a web application might want to maintain a counter per visitor to their site. In this case, the application would need to increment this counter regardless of its current value.

 A. True
 B. False		-Correct
Unattempted
Currently, Amazon S3 can publish the following events:
A new object created event—Amazon S3 supports multiple APIs to create objects. You can request notification when only a specific API is used (e.g., s3:ObjectCreated:Put) or you can use a wildcard (e.g., s3:ObjectCreated:*) to request notification when an object is created regardless of the API used.
An object removal event—Amazon S3 supports deletes of versioned and unversioned objects. You can request notification when an object is deleted or a versioned object is permanently deleted by using the s3:ObjectRemoved:Delete event type. Or you can request notification when a delete marker is created for a versioned object by usings3:ObjectRemoved:DeleteMarkerCreated. You can also use a wildcards3:ObjectRemoved:* to request notification anytime an object is deleted.
A Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) object lost event—Amazon S3 sends a notification message when it detects that an object of the RRS storage class has been lost.

 A. True		-Correct
 B. False
Unattempted
This is clearly mentioned in the AWS documentation
You can create indexes and perform lookups using attributes other than the item’s primary key. With this change, DynamoDB goes beyond the functionality traditionally provided by a key/value store, while retaining the scalability and performance benefits that have made it so popular with our customers.
You can now create up to five Global Secondary Indexes when you create a table, each referencing either a hash key or a hash key and a range key. You can also create up to five Local Secondary Indexes, and  you can choose to project some or all of the table’s attributes into each of the tables indexes.

25. Question
A local secondary index is an index that has the same hash key as the table, but a different range key. Choose the correct answer from the options below

 A. True		-Correct
 B. False
Unattempted
A local secondary index maintains an alternate sort key for a given partition key value. A local secondary index also contains a copy of some or all of the attributes from its base table; you specify which attributes are projected into the local secondary index when you create the table. The data in a local secondary index is organized by the same partition key as the base table, but with a different sort key. This lets you access data items efficiently across this different dimension. For greater query or scan flexibility, you can create up to five local secondary indexes per table.

28. Question
DynamoDB supports two types of primary keys, “Hash” and “Hash and Range” primary keys. Choose the correct answer from the options below

 A. True		-Correct
 B. False
Unattempted
The partition key of an item is also known as its hash attribute. The term hash attribute derives from DynamoDB’s usage of an internal hash function to evenly distribute data items across partitions, based on their partition key values.
The sort key of an item is also known as its range attribute. The term range attribute derives from the way DynamoDB stores items with the same partition key physically close together, in sorted order by the sort key value.

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.CoreComponents.html



29. Question
S3 bucket names may only contain only lower case letters, periods, numbers, and dashes but do not have to contain them all. Choose the correct answer from the options below

 A. True		-Correct
 B. False
Unattempted
Exception for S3 Nomenclature : Uppercase S3 bucket names are allowed in US-East(N.Virginia)
Following is the naming convention for S3. There is no rule mentioned that the names should have all combinations.
Bucket names must be at least 3 and no more than 63 characters long.
Bucket names must be a series of one or more labels. Adjacent labels are separated by a single period (.). Bucket names can contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens. Each label must start and end with a lowercase letter or a number.
Bucket names must not be formatted as an IP address (e.g., 192.168.5.4).
When using virtual hosted–style buckets with SSL, the SSL wildcard certificate only matches buckets that do not contain periods. To work around this, use HTTP or write your own certificate verification logic. We recommend that you do not use periods (“.”) in bucket names.

38. Question
True of False. A local secondary index has the same partition key as the primary key?

 A. True		-Correct
 B. False
Unattempted
Global secondary index — an index with a partition key and a sort key that can be different from those on the base table. A global secondary index is considered “global” because queries on the index can span all of the data in the base table, across all partitions.
Local secondary index — an index that has the same partition key as the base table, but a different sort key. A local secondary index is “local” in the sense that every partition of a local secondary index is scoped to a base table partition that has the same partition key value.

42. Question
When a failure occurs in a stack creation in Cloudformation, does a rollback occur?

 A. True		-Correct
 B. False
Unattempted
By default, the “automatic rollback on error” feature is enabled. This will cause all AWS resources that AWS CloudFormation created successfully for a stack up to the point where an error occurred to be deleted. This is useful when, for example, you accidentally exceed your default limit of Elastic IP addresses, or you don’t have access to an EC2 AMI you’re trying to run. This feature enables you to rely on the fact that stacks are either fully created, or not at all, which simplifies system administration and layered solutions built on top of AWS CloudFormation.

68. Question
A corporate web application is deployed within an Amazon VPC, and is connected to the corporate data center via IPSec VPN. The application must authenticate against the on-premise LDAP server. Once authenticated, logged-in users can only access an S3 keyspace specific to the user. Which two approaches can satisfy the objectives?
Choose 2 answers from the options below

 A. The application authenticates against LDAP, and retrieves the name of an IAM role associated with the user. The application then calls the IAM Security Token Service to assume that IAM Role. The application can use the temporary credentials to access the appropriate S3 bucket.		-Correct
 B. Develop an identity broker which authenticates against IAM Security Token Service to assume an IAM Role to get temporary AWS security credentials. The application calls the identity broker to get AWS temporary security credentials with access to the appropriate S3 bucket.
 C. The application authenticates against IAM Security Token Service using the LDAP credentials. The application uses those temporary AWS security credentials to access the appropriate S3 bucket.
 D. The application authenticates against LDAP. The application then calls the IAM Security Service to login to IAM using the LDAP credentials. The application can use the IAM temporary credentials to access the appropriate S3 bucket.
 E. Develop an identity broker which authenticates against LDAP, and then calls IAM Security Token Service to get IAM federated user credentials. The application calls the identity broker to get IAM federated user credentials with access to the appropriate S3 bucket.		-Correct
Unattempted
If you already manage user identities outside of AWS, you can use IAM identity providers instead of creating IAM users in your AWS account. With an identity provider , you can manage your user identities outside of AWS and give these external user identities permissions to use AWS resources in your account. This is useful if your organization already has its own identity system, such as a corporate user directory. It is also useful if you are creating a mobile app or web application that requires access to AWS resources.
Option B is incorrect as it Needs to authenticate against LDAP and not IAM.
Option C is incorrect as Need to authenticate with LDAP
Option D is incorrect as Can’t login to IAM using LDAP credentials

69. Question
You have written an application that uses the Elastic Load Balancing service to spread traffic to several web servers Your users complain that they are sometimes forced to login again in the middle of using your application, after they have already togged in. This is not behavior you have designed. What is a possible solution to prevent this happening? Choose an answer from the options below

 A. Use instance memory to save session state.
 B. Use instance storage to save session state.
 C. Use EBS to save session state
 D. Use ElastiCache to save session state.		-Correct
 E. Use Glacier to save session slate.
Unattempted
Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy and run Memcached or Redis protocol-compliant server nodes in the cloud. Amazon ElastiCache improves the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from a fast, managed, in-memory system, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based databases. The service simplifies and offloads the management, monitoring and operation of in-memory environments, enabling your engineering resources to focus on developing applications. Using Amazon ElastiCache, you can not only improve load and response times to user actions and queries, but also reduce the cost associated with scaling web applications. As an example for application session stickiness using Elastic cache, please refer to the below link: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/elasticache-as-an-asp-net-session-store/

71. Question
Which statements about DynamoDB are true? Choose 2 answers from the options below

 A. DynamoDB uses optimistic concurrency control		-Correct
 B. DynamoDB restricts item access during writes
 C. DynamoDB uses a pessimistic locking model
 D. DynamoDB restricts item access during reads
 E. DynamoDB uses conditional writes for consistency		-Correct
Unattempted
Optimistic locking is a strategy to ensure that the client-side item that you are updating (or deleting) is the same as the item in DynamoDB. If you use this strategy, then your database writes are protected from being overwritten by the writes of others — and vice-versa To help clients coordinate writes to data items, DynamoDB supports conditional writes for PutItem, DeleteItem, and UpdateItem operations. With a conditional write, an operation succeeds only if the item attributes meet one or more expected conditions; otherwise it returns an error For more information on working with items , please visit the link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/WorkingWithItems.html



72. Question
You are writing to a DynamoDB table and receive the following exception:” ProvisionedThroughputExceededException”, though according to your Cloudwatch metrics for the table, you are not exceeding your provisioned throughput. What could be an explanation for this?

 A. You haven’t provisioned enough DynamoDB storage instances
 B. You’re exceeding your capacity on a particular Range Key
 C. You’re exceeding your capacity on a particular Hash Key		-Correct
 D. You’re exceeding your capacity on a particular Sort Key
 E. You haven’t configured DynamoDB Auto Scaling triggers
Unattempted
This error normally occurs when the capacity on the main index key or hash key goes out of bounds. For more information on DynamoDB errors , please visit the link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Programming.Errors.html



73. Question
A meteorological system monitors 600 temperature gauges, obtaining temperature samples every minute and saving each sample to a DynamoDB table. Each sample involves writing 1K of data and the writes are evenly distributed over time. How much write throughput is required for the target table? Choose an answer from the options below

 A. 3600 write capacity units
 B. 1 write capacity unit
 C. 10 write capacity units		-Correct
 D. 60 write capacity units
 E. 600 write capacity units
Unattempted
Since each item is 1KB and if we near it to the nearest 1KB , we get 1 write capacity. Since we need 600 temperature gauges per minute , it becomes (600/60) = 1 per second. This gives is 10 write capacity units.

78. Question
If an application is storing hourly log files from thousands of instances from a high traffic web site, which naming scheme would give optimal performance on S3? Choose an answer from the options below

 A. Sequential
 B. HH-DD-MM-YYYY-log_instanceID		-Correct
 C. YYYY-MM-DD-HH-log_instanceID
 D. instanceID_log-HH-DD-MM-YYYY
 E. instanceID_log-YYYY-MM-DD-HH
Unattempted
Amazon S3 maintains an index of object key names in each AWS region. Object keys are stored in UTF-8 binary ordering across multiple partitions in the index. The key name dictates which partition the key is stored in. So if it is in an alphabetical sequence it can overwhelm the I/O capacity of the partition.
So introducing some randomness at the beginning of the file name in the naming scheme would give optimal performance.
In this scenario, thousands of instances are generating log files and are storing these log files on to S3 in an hourly manner. All the instance ID-s start with i-0*********. So if we go with this naming convention, thousands of log files are generated in each hour with these characters in the beginning of all the log files which doesn’t bring in the randomness required for the file names at the beginning. Hence options D & E are incorrect.
Option A is incorrect as it is mentioning to be Sequential. 
Option C is also incorrect since the Year value will take an year to change.
So out of the options given in the question option B seems to be ideal in this scenario.

81. Question
Your support teams calls you and tells you that the application you developed is giving the error “Your proposed upload exceeds the maximum allowed object size.” error message when uploading an object to S3. What is a possible solution for this? Choose an answer from the options below

 A. None, Simple Storage Service objects are limited to 5 GB
 B. Use the multi-part upload API for this object		-Correct
 C. Use the large object upload API for this object

Unattempted
Option A is correct because of the below excerpt from the AWS documentation
In Amazon SWF, tasks represent invocations of logical steps in applications. Tasks are processed by workers which are programs that interact with Amazon SWF to get tasks, process them, and return their results. A worker implements an application processing step. You can build workers in different programming languages and even reuse existing components to quickly create the worker. For example, you can use cloud services, enterprise applications, legacy systems, and even simple scripts to implement workers. By independently controlling the number of workers for processing each type of task, you can control the throughput of your application efficiently.
To coordinate the application execution across workers, you write a program called the decider in your choice of programming language. 
Option E is correct because of the below excerpt from the AWS documentation
Option F is correct because of the below excerpt from the AWS documentation
