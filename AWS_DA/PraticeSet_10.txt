27. Question
When using REST API with S3 what needs to set in the header request for encryption to occur for the object? Choose the correct answer from the options below

 A. x-amz-content-sha256
 B. x-amz-server-side-encryption		-Correct
 C. Content-MD5
 D. No header is needed
Unattempted
Server-side encryption is about protecting data at rest. Server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) employs strong multi-factor encryption. Amazon S3 encrypts each object with a unique key. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it regularly rotates. Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), to encrypt your data.
Amazon S3 supports bucket policies that you can use if you require server-side encryption for all objects that are stored in your bucket. 
For this you need to set the header as x-amz-server-side-encryption in the REST API call.
For more information on S3 server side encryption, please refer to the below URL:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html

 A. 300 seconds		-Correct
 B. 30 seconds
 C. 60 seconds
 D. 600 seconds
Unattempted
To ensure that a Classic Load Balancer stops sending requests to instances that are de-registering or unhealthy, while keeping the existing connections open, use connection draining. This enables the load balancer to complete in-flight requests made to instances that are de-registering or unhealthy. When you enable connection draining, you can specify a maximum time for the load balancer to keep connections alive before reporting the instance as de-registered. The maximum timeout value can be set between 1 and 3,600 seconds (the default is 300 seconds). When the maximum time limit is reached, the load balancer forcibly closes connections to the de-registering instance. For more information on ELB, please refer to the link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/config-conn-drain.html

Which API call would you create a new item in dynamoDB? Choose the correct answer from the options below

 A. PutItem		-Correct
 B. Scan
 C. GetItem
 D. query
Unattempted
Creates a new item, or replaces an old item with a new item. If an item that has the same primary key as the new item already exists in the specified table, the new item completely replaces the existing item. You can perform a conditional put operation (add a new item if one with the specified primary key doesn’t exist), or replace an existing item if it has certain attribute values. In addition to putting an item, you can also return the item’s attribute values in the same operation, using the ReturnValues parameter. For more information on the PutItem command please visit the below link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_GetItem.html



55. Question
If you are connecting to AWS from a computer, not an EC2 instance, you need to create an AWS user, attach permissions, and use the API access key and secret access key in your code. Choose the correct answer from the options below

 B. False
Unattempted
Users need their own access keys to make programmatic calls to AWS from the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), Tools for Windows PowerShell, the AWS SDKs, or direct HTTP calls using the APIs for individual AWS services. To fill this need, you can create, modify, view, or rotate access keys (access key IDs and secret access keys) for IAM users. For more information on IAM access keys please visit the link: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html

57. Question
An IAM role, when assigned to an EC2 instance, will allow code to be executed on that instance without API access keys. Choose the correct answer from the options below

 A. True		-Correct
 B. False
Unattempted
The best practise for IAM is to create roles which has specific access to an AWS service and then give the user permission to the AWS service via the role.
To get the role in place , follow the below steps
Step 1) Create a role which has the required ELB access
Step 2) You need to provide permissions to the underlying EC2 instances in the Elastic Load Balancer

62. Question
Buckets can contain both encrypted and non-encrypted objects. Choose the correct answer from the options below

 A. True		-Correct
 B. False
Unattempted
When objects are uploaded to S3 , they can either be encrypted or non-encrypted. There are various ways to encrypt objects is S3.
Use Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Keys (SSE-S3) – Each object is encrypted with a unique key employing strong multi-factor encryption. As an additional safeguard, it encrypts the key itself with a master key that it regularly rotates. Amazon S3 server-side encryption uses one of the strongest block ciphers available, 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-256), to encrypt your data. 
Use Server-Side Encryption with AWS KMS-Managed Keys (SSE-KMS) – Similar to SSE-S3, but with some additional benefits along with some additional charges for using this service. There are separate permissions for the use of an envelope key (that is, a key that protects your data’s encryption key) that provides added protection against unauthorized access of your objects in S3. SSE-KMS also provides you with an audit trail of when your key was used and by whom. Additionally, you have the option to create and manage encryption keys yourself, or use a default key that is unique to you, the service you’re using, and the region you’re working in. 
Use Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Keys (SSE-C) – You manage the encryption keys and Amazon S3 manages the encryption, as it writes to disks, and decryption, when you access your objects.
 For client side encryption please check below AWS docs link:
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingClientSideEncryption.html



63. Question
True or False: A core benefit of using a SQS subscription endpoint with Amazon SNS is that SQS Messages can be delivered to applications that require immediate notification of an event and messages are also persistent in an Amazon SQS queue for other applications to process later in time (considering the SQS limitation on how long the messages can be stored in SQS queue).

 A. True		-Correct
 B. False
Unattempted
The Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) and the Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) are important “glue” components for scalable, cloud-based applications (see the Reference Architectures in the AWS Architecture Center to learn more about how to put them to use in your own applications). One common design pattern is called “fanout.” In this pattern, a message published to an SNS topic is distributed to a number of SQS queues in parallel. By using this pattern, you can build applications that take advantage parallel, asynchronous processing For more information on SNS and SQS integration, please refer to the link: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/queues-and-notifications-now-best-friends/
